### Explore Bikeshare Data in US Cities
:bike: :cityscape: :earth_americas:

### Description
This project uses python to explore the data from bikeshare rentals within three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington - within the year 2017. The program will import raw data from CSV files, request raw user input and ask for confirmation of choices before the program computes descriptive statistics and outputs the first five rows of data.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are within the CSV files for all three cities, containing the same core six (6) columns:
> * Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
> * End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
> * Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
> * Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
> * End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
> * User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
> * Gender
> * Birth Year
